Teaching Statement\newline
\today

I don't believe in teaching. I believe in learning. I believe that learning
happens when someone has a motivation to learn and an ability to do it.
Well, I think I'm wrong about the ability---just motivation.
The motivation is the derivative of the answer so many students
struggle to find for the simple question: ``What's in it for me?''
