<a href="/2018/07/24/bugs-or-pull-requests.html">what do you do</a>?
You submit a GitHub issue (or whatever ticket tracking system they use).
In the issue, you describe the problem in the best possible way, preferably
providing a working code example that the author of the library can run locally
to reproduce the bug. If you don’t provide them with an executable snippet of code,
they will most likely ask you to do so, unless the bug is trivial.
I suggest simplifying the workflow and giving them what they want right
in a pull request: send them the bug in the form of a disabled unit test.</p>

<p>Say, there is a Rust library that provides a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibo()</code> function that 
calculates a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci number</a>, 
which you can use this way:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">n</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">23</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">fibo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nd">println!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"The {n}th Fibonacci is {x}"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You run it and it prints <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">17711</code>, which is mistakenly the 22nd Fibonacci number,
not the 23rd. It is definitely a bug. You submit a ticket, saying something like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>I'm trying to use your library to calculate 
a Fibonacci  number, but for some reason, I'm 
getting a wrong result:  the 23rd number your 
library returns is 17711, while I'm expecting 
the number 28657. Please check and fix.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>They will reply “Can you prove it, please? Show us the code!” and
you will probably add this code to the ticket:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nf">fibo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">23</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nd">assert_eq!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">28657</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, if they are <a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">disciplined</a> 
programmers, a new unit test will be created and the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fibo()</code> function will be fixed. Moreover, if they are 
<a href="/2022/08/04/code-and-tests-different-pull-requests.html">very disciplined</a> programmers, 
they will submit the test in a separate pull request, disabling it. Then, in
the second pull request, they will make a fix.</p>

<p>Why can’t you help them and skip the issue submission step? Just make the
first pull request yourself, with the disabled test inside and a 
<a href="/2010/03/04/pdd.html">“puzzle”</a> added to it:</p>

<div class="language-rust highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">// @todo #42 This test is disabled because the</span>

<p>Such a PR serves as both a bug report
(this is what the text of the puzzle will be turned into, once the PR is merged)
and a test that reproduces the problem. It will be more than welcome
by the repository maintenance team. This kind of PR saves the time
they would spend creating a unit test. Also, it saves your time for
creating a bug report, as it will be created automatically by
<a href="/2014/04/12/puzzle-driven-development-by-roles.html">the puzzles discovery tool</a>.</p>

conducted by <a href="https://www.jemielniak.org/">Dariusz Jemielniak</a> in 2007, the majority of programmers perceive 
their own managers as highly incompetent. We don’t expect our bosses to be 
coding-savvy—this level of technical competence is <a href="/2016/05/24/who-is-project-manager.html">not a requirement</a>
for an average manager. Additionally, we don’t expect them to excel in 
Gantt Chart wizardry or adhere strictly to 
<a href="/2019/05/14/cause-risk-effect.html">risk management protocols</a>—these 
are management practices that are not commonly observed in software teams today.
Instead, what we do expect from them is the ability to gauge our productivity: 
recognizing and rewarding the best performers while 
<a href="/2015/09/16/how-to-fire-someone-right.html">taking action</a> against those who are less motivated. 
Unfortunately, this is a management competence that they lack… or perhaps, 
<a href="/2021/03/03/imposters-to-win.html">fortunately</a>.</p>

<figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Les côtelettes (2003) by Bertrand Blier" src="/images/2023/07/les-cotelettes.jpg" longdesc="#de422d8c" /><figcaption id="de422d8c">Les côtelettes (2003) by Bertrand Blier</figcaption></figure>

<p>I believe that the ability to measure results objectively is what makes a competent manager. The
recent desire of large tech companies to restrict and/or entirely prohibit remote work has
highlighted the lack of this ability in the industry. Indeed, a manager who knows how to evaluate
the work of the team and its individual members wouldn’t worry about whether they are co-located in
an office or working remotely. It simply <a href="/2017/05/02/remote-slaves.html">wouldn’t matter</a>! 
If programmers know that <a href="/2014/09/24/why-monetary-awards-dont-work.html">rewards</a> will be
given for deliverables and that penalties will occur in their absence, they can find the best place
to create these deliverables, be it at home, in the office, or at a coffee shop (I’m one of them).
However, if programmers don’t have such a straightforward 
“<a href="/2018/10/09/can-you-control-us.html">reward and punishment</a>” system, they can
become lazy and demotivated. To get back on track, they need a manager, an office, and daily
<a href="/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html">supervision</a>.</p>

<p>Google recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/08/google-to-crack-down-on-hybrid-work-asks-remote-workers-to-reconsider.html">said</a>
that “working together in the same room makes a positive difference”…
for Google’s <del>incompetent</del> managers, I guess. 
They may judge productivity by the amount of time their coders spend staring at monitors. 
They don’t need to concern themselves with establishing an objective performance evaluation system. 
They don’t need to count the <a href="/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">lines of code</a> 
(it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zen0B0SNwI">nonsense</a>, because Bill Gates said so!). 
They don’t need to break down the scope into tasks and then assess their complexity 
(that’s unfeasible, since we programmers are <a href="/2016/09/27/command-control-innovate.html">artists</a>!). 
They don’t need to risk damaging 
<a href="/2015/03/02/team-morale-myths-and-reality.html">morale</a> 
and creativity by introducing the concept of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZcNHZ_FJco">productivity evaluation</a> 
(that’s unthinkable!). 
They can simply reward the most disciplined clock-watchers and call it a management.</p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps it’s not entirely detrimental for some of us. If the management 
is <a href="/2017/08/01/how-to-manage-a-manager.html">incompetent</a> 
enough to “make office attendance part of performance reviews” 
(as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/google-makes-office-attendance-part-of-performance-reviews/">Google just has</a>), 
let’s play along and provide them with what they want: let’s attend! 
Let’s display our <a href="/2015/10/06/how-to-be-good-office-slave.html">loyalty</a>, 
engagement, and <a href="https://www.yegor256.com/pdf/2019/enthusiasm.pdf">enthusiasm</a>, 
rather than our <a href="/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html">lines of code</a> 
and <a href="/2018/07/24/bugs-or-pull-requests.html">pull requests</a>. 
Let’s focus on fitting into the group rather than contributing to the codebase.</p>

<p>Woody Allen <a href="https://www.creativelive.com/blog/the-importance-of-showing-up/">once remarked</a> that “80 percent of success
is showing up.” I would propose that we repurpose this as career advice for us programmers: Just Show Up. This mantra
applies not only to office attendance, but can also be applied to many other activities throughout your 
<a href="/2017/01/24/career-advice.html">career development</a>. 
You should be where your boss(es) can physically see you. No, not your work—that’s immaterial. They need
to see you in person. Here’s what you can do to truly “Just Show Up”:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Participate in all <a href="/2015/07/13/meetings-are-legalized-robbery.html">meetings</a>;</li>
  <li>Attend all events, workshops, and team-building activities;</li>
  <li>Situate yourself next to the boss;</li>
  <li>Become a member of all committees;</li>
  <li>Seize every opportunity to <a href="/2020/12/29/metric-for-emotions.html">ask questions</a>;</li>
  <li>Be vocal in the office to ensure that your boss hears you;</li>
  <li>Submit proposals whenever they’re requested;</li>
  <li>Respond to all emails;</li>
  <li>Upvote every chat message.</li>
</ul>

<p>This strategy might not necessarily make you a better programmer, 
but it will certainly <a href="/2016/01/05/how-to-punish-employees.html">convince</a> 
your boss that you are one.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="management" /><category term="mood" /><category term="career" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since many managers may not have the expertise to assess our technical work, the best strategy for seeming a top performer is to be visible to your manager often.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2023/07/les-cotelettes.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2023/07/les-cotelettes.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">On the Layout of Tests</title><link href="https://www.yegor256.com/2023/01/19/layout-of-tests.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On the Layout of Tests" /><published>2023-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yegor256.com/2023/01/19/layout-of-tests</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yegor256.com/2023/01/19/layout-of-tests.html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t know what programming language you use, but my experience 
of recent coding in Java, Ruby, JavaScript, PHP, Python, C++, and Rust tells 
me that the principle, which I will try to convince you to adhere 
to—is universal for all languages. It’s about the naming of test files. 
It may look to you like a question of low importance, but let me try 
to demonstrate that it’s not. How do you name your files with test classes? How many 
of them do you create in the src/test/java directory? Where do you place
a class that is used only in a test but is not a test by itself? To most of these
questions, the answer most of you would give is “Whatever!”
So let’s try to find a better answer.</p>

<figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Мимино (1977) by Георгий Данелия" src="/images/2022/11/mimino.jpg" longdesc="#06bd8b4f" /><figcaption id="06bd8b4f">Мимино (1977) by Георгий Данелия</figcaption></figure>

<p>The primary purpose of my unit tests is to help me code. They are the 
<a href="/2022/07/05/safety-net.html">safety net</a>—they 
catch me when I make a mistake. For example, let’s say I go back and edit a few files that I 
edited a few years ago and, of course, I do it wrong this time. Then, I run all 500 unit tests
in the project, and … ten of them turn red. Pay attention, I don’t say “fail” because, 
just like a safety net around a building, failed tests are the tests 
that didn’t catch a falling hammer and didn’t spot a bug just introduced.
Thus, 490 of them <em>failed</em>, but ten of them <em>succeeded</em>.</p>

<h2 id="assertions">Assertions</h2>

<p>Next, I scratch my head and think—what exactly did I do wrong? Which 
file did I break? I just changed a few dozen code lines. Where exactly was the 
mistake? In order to find out, I read the output of the tests. I expect 
the messages they print to the console to be descriptive enough to 
help me understand the problem. I don’t want to revert all my changes 
and start from scratch, right? I want to quickly jump to the line with 
the bug, fix it, rerun all 500 tests, see all of them green, 
commit my changes and call it a day.</p>

<p>Needless to say, descriptive messages of test assertions 
and proper naming of test methods are the recipe for success.
Let’s consider simple object Phrases, where we add 
a few English phrases, and it magically understands which 
of them are greetings (obviously, using ML).
For such a class, this Java/JUnit5 test would be very bad:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.junit.jupiter.api.Test</span><span class="o">;</span>

  <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this test is much better, thanks to <a href="https://www.hamcrest.org">Hamcrest</a>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first snippet will print a pretty obscure error message, while the
second one will help me a lot in my struggle with the bug I just made:
The message will be self-explanatory. I will quickly understand
what the problem is.</p>

<h2 id="test-classes">Test Classes</h2>

<p>Descriptive messages will help me understand what the problem is.
However, will I know <em>where</em> the problem is? In which Java class? Not really.
Is it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phrases.java,</code> or maybe in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Greetings.java,</code> which is returned by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phrases.greetings()</code>?
I can only get this information from the <em>name</em> of the test class.
If it’s called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhrasesTest.java</code>—all bugs that it catches <em>are most probably</em>
located in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phrases.java.</code> If it’s called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GreetingsTest.java</code>—… well, you get the idea.</p>

<p>My point is that the name of a test class is not just a name. It’s an instruction
for a wondering programmer:
“Go look into the source file, the name of which you can derive from my name,
removing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test</code> suffix.” If I try to follow this instruction and
it leads me nowhere, I get very frustrated, especially if the project
is not mine. I can’t get the required information from anywhere else.
The name of the test class is my last hope.</p>

<h2 id="very-long-test-classes">Very Long Test Classes</h2>

<p>What if a test class gets too long? It may have a few dozen or more test methods. We don’t
want a class to be too big, right? Wrong! A test class is not a class. It’s not even 
a utility class. It’s a container for test scripts. It’s called a class because
Java (and many other languages) do not have alternative code 
organization instruments. So don’t worry about your test classes getting excessively long. 5000 lines of code 
in a test class is <em>not a problem</em> at all. Again, because it’s not a class, it’s only
a collection of test scripts.</p>

<h2 id="test-prerequisites-wrong-way">Test Prerequisites (Wrong Way)</h2>

<p>Very often some classes or functions  are not tests,
but must be shared among tests. (I’m sure you know that sharing tests is an
<a href="/2018/12/11/unit-testing-anti-patterns.html">anti-pattern</a>. Do you?)
Look at how I refactored the unit test from above (it’s not elegant
at all, but bear with me for a moment!):</p>

<p>Here, in private method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prepare(),</code> I have a convenient builder
of the object of class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Phrases.</code> This builder may be beneficial
for other tests, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GreetingsTest.</code> I don’t want
to copy it from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhrasesTest</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GreetingsTest.</code> Instead, I
want to put it somewhere where it can be reused. This would
be the right place for it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> is the Java
package that all our classes belong to):</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>src/
  main/
    java/
      foo/
        Phrases.java
        Greetings.java
  test/
    java/
      foo/
        support/
          FooUtils.java
        PhrasesTest.java
        GreetingsTest.java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Static method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FooUtils.prepare()</code> now sits in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FooUtils</code> utility
class (a terrible <a href="/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html">anti-pattern</a>!),
which is in the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.support</code>. But, pay attention, not in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo</code> package, but
in the sub-package that doesn’t have a counterpart in the live code block:
there is no directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/main/java/foo/support.</code> This is a clear message
to a programmer who would meet this repository in a few years: all classes
that stay in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.support</code> belong to the test pipeline only and are not tests by
themselves.</p>

<h2 id="test-prerequisites-right-way">Test Prerequisites (Right Way)</h2>

<p>As <a href="/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html">you know</a>,
utility classes and <a href="/2017/02/07/private-method-is-new-class.html">private static methods</a>
are the rudiments of imperative programming. The object-oriented world has better alternatives.
JUnit5, in particular, offers pretty elegant mechanisms for
creating test prerequisites: <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#extensions-registration">test extensions</a>.
Everything that a test method needs we supply through its parameters,
which are instantiated by extensions, for example:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.*</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PhrasesExtension</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">ParameterResolver</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">supportsParameter</span><span class="o">(</span>

  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">Object</span> <span class="nf">resolveParameter</span><span class="o">(</span>
    <span class="nc">ParameterContext</span> <span class="n">pctx</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">ExtensionContext</span> <span class="n">ectx</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nc">Phrases</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Phrases</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"London is a capital of Great Britain"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, the test will look like this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.ExtendWith</span><span class="o">;</span>

<span class="nd">@ExtendWith</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">PhrasesExtension</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PhrasesTest</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Test</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">countsSimpleGreetings</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Phrases</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">assertThat</span><span class="o">(</span>
      <span class="s">"Total count of greetings"</span><span class="o">,</span>
      <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">greetings</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">count</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="n">equalTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, the test and its prerequisites stay in two different places and are not
as tightly coupled as they were before. Moreover, the prerequisites may be
easily reused. The magic <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ExtendWith</code> annotation may be attached to other
tests. The implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhrasesExtension</code> may become smarter: it
may start paying attention not only to the type of argument of a test method
but also to a custom annotation attached to it (this is how
<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.4.1/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/io/TempDir.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@TempDir</code></a> works).</p>

<h2 id="fake-objects-best-way">Fake Objects (Best Way)</h2>

<p>Despite the beauty of JUnit extensions, I don’t think they are the best way
to decouple prerequisites from test methods. JUnit extensions are still pretty
coupled … not to test methods, but to the entire test suite of a project. If you
decide to use them somewhere else, in another project, you won’t be able to do so.</p>

<p>Also, if you decide to test your prerequisites, you won’t be able to do
it elegantly. Of course, you could write tests for them in the same directory, but in this case,
you will break the principle: one test per one live class.</p>

<p>The solution is: <a href="/2014/09/23/built-in-fake-objects.html">fake objects</a>.
They stay together with other live objects, but have special “fake” behavior,
for example (BTW, I <a href="/2017/11/14/static-factory-methods.html">don’t like factories</a>,
but in this case, it’s OK):</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">FactoryOfPhrases</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">Phrases</span> <span class="nf">aboutLondon</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nc">Phrases</span> <span class="n">p</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Phrases</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Hello, world!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"London is a capital of Great Britain"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">p</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, the test will look like this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">PhrasesTest</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nd">@Test</span>
  <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">countsSimpleGreetings</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">assertThat</span><span class="o">(</span>
      <span class="s">"Total count of greetings"</span><span class="o">,</span>
      <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">FactoryOfPhrases</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">aboutLondon</span><span class="o">()</span>
        <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">greetings</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">count</span><span class="o">(),</span>
      <span class="n">equalTo</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Repository layout would look like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>src/
  main/
    java/
      foo/
        FactoryOfPhrases.java
        Phrases.java
        Greetings.java
  test/
    java/
      foo/
        FactoryOfPhrasesTest.java
        PhrasesTest.java
        GreetingsTest.java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Pay attention to the test <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FactoryOfPhrasesTest.</code> It tests the “fake” object <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FactoryOfPhrases,</code>
which is part of the live classes collection. The factory of phases is shipped together
with all other classes. Therefore, it can be used by other projects and not only for test
purposes.</p>

<p>To summarize, as a rule, I suggest keeping test classes clean: only test methods
belong there. No attributes and, of course, no static private methods. Everything
that is a prerequisite must be a “fake” object.</p>

<h2 id="integration-tests">Integration Tests</h2>

<p>In the Maven world, there are unit test classes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test</code> suffix),
and integration test classes (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ITCase</code> suffix).
The difference is huge. While both are compiled at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test-compile</code> phase
by the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">maven-compiler-plugin,</code> they are not executed together.
Instead, unit tests are executed at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code> phase. The build fails immediately if
any unit test is red. It’s a pretty straightforward approach, which
is similar to other build automation engines.</p>

<p>Integration tests are executed in four steps (these are the names of Maven phases):</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pre-integration-test
integration-test
post-integration-test
verify
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>First, the resources needed for integration testing are acquired
at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pre-integration-test</code> phase. For example, a test instance of MySQL 
database may be started. Then, the tests with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ITCase</code> are executed at the ‘integration-test’ phase. The 
result of their execution is ignored for now but only recorded in a file. 
Then, the resources are released at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">post-integration-test</code> phase.
For example, the MySQL server is shut down. Finally, at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verify</code> phase, 
the results of the tests are verified, and the build fails if 
some of them are not green.</p>

<p>I keep <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ITCase</code> files together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test</code> files only when they are
integration tests for specific live classes. Very often, they are not—that’s why
they are integration tests. They may integrate and test a number of classes together.
In this case, I put them in a separate package and gave them arbitrary names
that don’t match with the names of live classes:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>src/
  main/
    java/
      foo/
        Phrases.java
        Greetings.java
  test/
    java/
      foo/
        it/
          SimpleGuessingITCase.java
        PhrasesTest.java
        GreetingsTest.java
        GreetingsITCase.java
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GreetingsITCase.java</code> is an integration test for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Greetings.java,</code>
while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SimpleGuessingITCase.java</code> is an integration test for no particular
class. Obviously, the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">foo.it</code> only exists in tests and is not
present in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/main/java.</code></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Thus, there is the first rule:
a test class may only have methods
annotated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Test</code> (in the case of Java).</p>

<p>Then, there is the second rule:
a package with tests may only have classes with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Test</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ITCase</code> suffices
that map one-to-one to live classes and nothing else.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="tests" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the right way to keep test classes in a repository?

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I believe that its try/catch block is too big. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IOException</code> may only be
thrown by the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Files.html#readAllLines-java.nio.file.Path-"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readAllLines</code></a>
static method, but the block covers a few other method calls
and statements. This code would be better:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">grep</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Path</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">Pattern</span> <span class="n">regex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Files</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">readAllLines</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">file</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">IOException</span> <span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">IllegalStateException</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">ex</span><span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">regex</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">matcher</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">line</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">matches</span><span class="o">())</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now the try/catch block covers exactly the place where the exception
may originate. Nothing else!</p>

<p>Why are smaller try-blocks better? Because they allow more
focused error reporting with more detailed context. For example, the
second snippet can be re-written as follows:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">grep</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Path</span> <span class="n">file</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">Pattern</span> <span class="n">regex</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

  <span class="k">for</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">line</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">lines</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

In Java we do this more often than in other languages, because it has
<a href="/2015/07/28/checked-vs-unchecked-exceptions.html">checked</a> exceptions.
Sometimes we must catch and rethrow a few exceptions that originated
from different places in a method.
Java 7 introduced <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html">grouping</a>
of different types of exceptions in a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block.
But even without the grouping, it is possible to just catch <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IOException</code> or
even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Exception</code> and provide a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block for all types and all
originators (methods that throw).
Recently I realized that this is a bad practice. Here is why.</p>

<p>Consider this Java method (I’m using <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/">Apache Commons IO</a>):</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">uri</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<p>It’s not perfect. Let’s rewrite it to provide more error context,
as <a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">was suggested</a> earlier:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">byte</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="nf">read</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">uri</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

      <span class="o">),</span>
      <span class="n">ex</span>
    <span class="o">);</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, the exception may be thrown in three places:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By the <a href="/2015/05/07/ctors-must-be-code-free.html">constructor</a>
of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.net.URL</code></a></li>
  <li>By the method <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URL.html#openStream%28%29"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openStream()</code></a></li>
  <li>By the method <a href="https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/apidocs/org/apache/commons/io/IOUtils.html#toByteArray-java.io.InputStream-"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toByteArray</code></a></li>
</ul>

<p>No matter who throws, we catch it in the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block and rethrow
with the same message. I believe that this is bad because the <a href="/2015/12/01/rethrow-exceptions.html">context</a>
of the error provided by rethrowing is less focused on the issue that occurred.</p>

<p>I would suggest this refactoring
(I don’t close the input stream, which is wrong,
but that’s a topic for a separate discussion):</p>

<p>This code is much longer, but at the same time more convenient to
<a href="/2016/02/09/are-you-still-debugging.html">debug</a>,
test, and use in production mode. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block
is able to explain the situation better and provide better
context in the rethrown exception, because it deals only with
a single case.</p>

<p>Thus, the rule I’m suggesting: if an exception is caught,
each originator must have its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">catch</code> block.</p>

<p>Obviously, I believe that
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/catch-multiple.html">grouping exception types</a>

I’m writing two papers right now and co-authoring about ten others.
So far, my results are very poor: way more rejections than I expected.
The key lesson I’ve learned so far: the reason most papers get rejected
is not because they are essentially wrong. Instead, reviewers reject them
because they have no enthusiasm for decrypting a poorly structured text,
even though it may contain potentially interesting thoughts.
In this blog post I suggest how to structure a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_paper">research paper</a>.
Take it with a grain of salt though.</p>

<p>Keep the same <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/academic-skills/study-skills-online/academic-writing">organizational structure</a> in each paragraph.</p>

<h2 id="title">Title</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news-blog/how-to-write-a-good-research-science-academic-paper-title">title</a>
is the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02404-4">key message</a> of your paper.</p>

<p>Use <a href="https://blog.wordvice.com/how-to-write-the-perfect-title-for-your-research-paper/">this method</a> to invent it.</p>

<h2 id="authors">Authors</h2>

<p>I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TF8MKOfo3gI">suggest</a> the following rule:
The first author in the list is you.
The last one is your boss.
Key contributors stay in the middle, in alphabetic order of their last names.
Everybody else is listed in the Acknowledgments section.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>An <a href="https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/assignments/writing-an-abstract-for-your-research-paper/">abstract</a>
is a one-paragraph version of the paper, with an emphasis
on Introduction, Results, and Discussion.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Answer these questions in this particular order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is going on in your field of study?</li>
  <li>What is wrong?</li>
  <li>Why is this Problem important?</li>
  <li>Why is it not fixed yet by others?</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, formulate your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_question">Research Question(s)</a>
or a <a href="https://www.enago.com/academy/how-to-develop-a-good-research-hypothesis/">Hypothesis</a>.</p>

<p>Next, make a disputable <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/thesis-statements/">Thesis Statement</a>.</p>

<p>Then, enumerate the Contributions that your article makes to science.
A Contribution is something tangible, which a reader can take from your study
and use somehow in their own studies.
A theorem, a method, a toolkit, a data-set, or an algorithm are good examples of a Contribution.</p>

<p><del>Finally, help your reader understand how the rest of the paper is structured and why.</del>
Don’t do this! Instead, finish each paragraph in this Section with something along this line:
“In Section X we will explain it.”</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>A reader may not know much about your field of study. This section
may help them understand your problem domain and its terminology better.
For example, if you write about a new programming language, this section may explain
what a compiler is, and grammar, front-end, back-end, AST, and so on.</p>

<p>Educate your readers in order to make it more comfortable for them
to read the rest of the paper.</p>

<h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>

<p>In the first paragraph, give an overview of all existing studies that
you managed to find. Classify them somehow.</p>

<p>Then write one paragraph per study. Explain what the study was about
and what are its key findings. Finish each paragraph with the flaws
you found in the study. Make a claim that due to these flaws this
study is not a solution to the Problem.</p>

<p>Finish the section with a paragraph claiming that, to the best of your knowledge,
not a single existing study solves the Problem.</p>

<h2 id="method-or-device">Method or Device</h2>

<p>There are two types of research:
you either <em>observe</em> the reality in order to discover its new laws
(this is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a>
discovered his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion">laws of motion</a>),
or <em>extend</em> the reality with a new device
(this is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a> invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb">light bulb</a>).</p>

<p>If you observe, algorithmically <a href="https://research.com/research/how-to-write-research-methodology">describe</a> the Method.</p>

<p>If you extend, describe the Device and its usage scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>

<p>Formally prove that your Device possesses certain qualities, predicted in the Hypothesis.</p>

<p>The section mostly consists of definitions, examples, lemmas, theorems, and proofs.</p>

<h2 id="experimental-results">Experimental Results</h2>

<p>Apply the Method, step by step, to the real data.</p>

<p>Present your findings using tables and graphs.</p>

<p>Post your input data, intermediate data, and all output data in a public
GitHub repository. Make a reference to it.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>Informally <a href="https://plos.org/resource/how-to-write-conclusions/">interpret</a> your results.</p>

<p>Explain how your results are different from Related Work.</p>

<p>Highlight limitations of the study. Discuss its <a href="https://www.creative-wisdom.com/teaching/WBI/threat.shtml">threats to validity</a>.
Any method or any idea has its flaws. If you don’t admit them, your
readers will think that you are either concealing the issues or
not understanding your own domain well enough.</p>

<p>Highlight the significance of the study.</p>

<p>Discuss unanswered questions and suggest topics for future studies.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Spend one paragraph explaining how your research question was answered
in this paper. Imagine the reader just reads the Introduction and
then immediately this Conclusion. It should read fluently.</p>

<p>This paragraph is a short version of the Discussion.</p>

<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Here, you say “many thanks to individuals and organizations that
contributed to the research, including …” You list them all, in
alphabetic order. You may add your bosses, colleagues, people
who reviewed your paper, your parents, and even your dog.</p>

<p>If the research was done while you were an employee of ACME Inc.,
say that “the research was funded by ACME Inc.”</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>Use <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex?lang=en">BibLaTeX</a> to automate citations,
and <a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701">read this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="appendices">Appendices</h2>

<p>Long tables, complex proofs, large figures are good candidates for placing
into appendices. Keeping them in the main part of the paper may jeopardize
its readability.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="science" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a very simplified guideline for newbie academic writers like myself, to help you structure a paper in a way that won't surprise your reviewers too much.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2022/08/il-camorrista.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2022/08/il-camorrista.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Declarative and Immutable Pipeline of Transformations</title><link href="https://www.yegor256.com/2022/08/10/xsline-immutable-pipeline.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Declarative and Immutable Pipeline of Transformations" /><published>2022-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-08-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.yegor256.com/2022/08/10/xsline-immutable-pipeline</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.yegor256.com/2022/08/10/xsline-immutable-pipeline.html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago I made a <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline">small Java library</a>,
which is worth explaining since
the design of its classes and interfaces is pretty unusual. It’s very much
object-oriented for a pretty imperative task: building a pipeline of
document transformations. The goal was to do this in a declarative and
immutable way, and in Java. Well, as much as it’s possible.</p>

<figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="Barfuss (2005) by Til Schweiger" src="/images/2022/08/barfuss.jpg" longdesc="#53e51a8f" /><figcaption id="53e51a8f">Barfuss (2005) by Til Schweiger</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s say you have a document, and you have a collection of transformations,
each of which will do something with the document. Each transformation, for example,
is a small piece of Java code. You want to build a list
of transformations and then pass a document through this list.</p>

<p>First, I made an interface <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/Shift.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code></a>

<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I made an interface <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/Train.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code></a>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ah, I forgot to tell you. I’m a big fan of <a href="/2014/06/09/objects-should-be-immutable.html">immutable</a>
objects. That’s why the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code> doesn’t have a method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code>, but instead has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code>. The difference is that
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> modifies the object, while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> makes a new one.</p>

<p>Now, I can build a train of shifts with
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/TrDefault.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrDefault</code></a>,
a simple default implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code>, assuming
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShiftA</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ShiftB</code> are already implemented:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">()</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftA</span><span class="o">())</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftB</span><span class="o">());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then I created an <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/Xsline.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Xsline</code></a>
class (it’s “XSL” + “pipeline”, since in my case
I’m managing XML documents and transform them using XSL stylesheets). An instance
of this class encapsulates an instance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code> and then passes a document
through all its transformations:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Document</span> <span class="n">input</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">...;</span>
<span class="nc">Document</span> <span class="n">output</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Xsline</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">train</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">pass</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">input</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far so good.</p>

<p>Now, I want all my transformations to log themselves. I created
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/StLogged.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StLogged</code></a>,
a decorator of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>, which encapsulates the original <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>, decorates its method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apply</code>,
and prints a message to the console when the transformation is completed:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">StLogged</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="nc">Shift</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">final</span> <span class="nc">Shift</span> <span class="n">origin</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="nd">@Override</span>
  <span class="nc">Document</span> <span class="nf">apply</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">Document</span> <span class="n">before</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nc">Document</span> <span class="n">after</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">origin</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">apply</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">before</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Transformation completed!"</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">after</span><span class="o">;</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, I have to do this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">()</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">StLogged</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftA</span><span class="o">()))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">StLogged</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftB</span><span class="o">()));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like a duplication of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new StLogged(</code>, especially with a collection of a few dozen
shifts. To get rid of this duplication I created a decorator for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code>, which
on the fly decorates shifts that it encapsulates, using
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/StLogged.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StLogged</code></a>:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrLogged</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">())</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftA</span><span class="o">()))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">ShiftB</span><span class="o">());</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In my case, all shifts are doing XSL transformations, taking XSL stylesheets from
files available in classpath. That’s why the code looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrLogged</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">())</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">StXSL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-a.xsl"</span><span class="o">)))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">StXSL</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-b.xsl"</span><span class="o">)));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is an obvious duplication of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new StXSL(...)</code>, but I can’t simply get rid of it,
since the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">with</code> expects an instance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Shift</code>, not a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>. To solve this,
I made the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train</code> generic and created
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/TrClasspath.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrClasspath</code></a>
decorator:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrClasspath</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;())</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-a.xsl"</span><span class="o">))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-b.xsl"</span><span class="o">));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrClasspath.with()</code> accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>, turns it into
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/StXSL.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StXSL</code></a>
and passes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrDefault.with()</code>.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the snippet above: the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">train</code> is now of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train&lt;String&gt;</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train&lt;Shift&gt;</code>,
as would be required by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Xsline</code>.
The question now is: how do we get back to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train&lt;Shift&gt;</code>?</p>

        <div>Object Thinking #7: Yegor Bugayenko / Immutability + Generics;
        22 September 2022.</div></aside>

<p>Ah, I forgot to mention. I wanted to design this library with one important principle
in mind, <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">suggested</a>
in 2014: all objects may only implement methods from their interfaces. That’s why,
I couldn’t just add a method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getEncapsulatedTrain()</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrClasspath</code>.</p>

<p>I introduced a new interface
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/Train.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train.Temporary&lt;T&gt;</code></a>
with a single method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">back()</code>
returning <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Train&lt;T&gt;</code>. The class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrClasspath</code> implements
it and I can do this:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Train</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Shift</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrClasspath</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;(</span><span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;())</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-a.xsl"</span><span class="o">))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"stylesheet-b.xsl"</span><span class="o">))</span>
  <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">back</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next I decided to get rid of the duplication of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.with()</code> calls. Obviously, it would
be easier to have the ability to provide a list of file names as an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">String</code>
and build the train from it. I created a new class
<a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xsline/blob/0.5.2/src/main/java/com/yegor256/xsline/TrBulk.java"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TrBulk</code></a>,
which does exactly that:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Iterable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">String</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Arrays</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">asList</span><span class="o">(</span>
  <span class="s">"stylesheet-a.xsl"</span><span class="o">,</span>
  <span class="s">"stylesheet-b.xsl"</span>
<span class="o">);</span>
<span class="nc">Train</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Shift</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">train</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrBulk</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;(</span>
  <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrClasspath</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;(</span>
    <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">TrDefault</span><span class="o">&lt;&gt;()</span>
  <span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">).</span><span class="na">with</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">names</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">back</span><span class="o">();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this design I can construct the train in almost any possible way.</p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/yegor256/status/1525758255225528320">on Twitter</a>
and got mostly negative reactions. That’s why I wrote this blog post, to elaborate on the
subject in an attempt to convince you. Here is the rule I’m suggesting:
always submit changes to the code separately from the changes to
its unit tests. Simply put, in one pull request you modify the tests, maybe
marking some of them as “disabled.” You merge this pull request and then
make the second one, modifying the code and most probably
removing the “disabled” markers from the tests. You don’t touch the
body of the tests in the second pull request.</p>

<p>It may look like a contradiction of the principles of
<a href="/2017/03/24/tdd-that-works.html">TDD</a>.
However, to me this approach looks like an extreme application of TDD, not a violation
of it. First we merge the tests, which most probably will break the build, since
the functionality that they test is not present yet. In order to avoid the broken
state of the build we disable the new tests that we added and the tests that we modified.
In <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/">JUnit 5</a>, for example, we do this with
<a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/5.0.0-M2/api/org/junit/jupiter/api/Disabled.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Disabled</code></a> annotation.</p>

<p>Reviewers validate the changes you make, asking themselves these questions:
“Do we really need this new functionality?
Does it conflict with the existing functionality?
Does it make sense to test new functionality this particular way?”
They don’t think about <em>how</em> the functionality will be implemented, they
only care about the <em>requirements</em> you impose in your tests against the
product. The reviewers act more or less as requirements engineers at this stage.
They validate the <em>intent</em>, not the <em>realization</em> of it.</p>

<p>Then, in the second pull request, you modify the code without touching the tests.
Now, reviewers can rest assured that you haven’t changed the requirements just to make
them more suitable for your implementation. In other words, they know that you didn’t <em>cheat</em>.
Since you didn’t touch the tests, it’s a guarantee for reviewers that requirements
remain stable and you only modify the implementation. Speaking business language,
you don’t change the <em>contract</em> if/when you understand that you can’t deliver
what was <em>promised</em>.</p>

<p>Moreover, when you modify the tests only, without touching the code, it’s much
easier for the reviewers to understand whether or not your changes truly belong to the
problem you are supposed to be solving. We programmers tend to make a typical mistake:
we make changes to the code, some tests fail, we fix the tests … no matter whether
they are “our” tests or not. We simply make the tests pass regardless of <em>why</em> they fail.
Instead of <em>listening</em> to them, we shut them up. Later, the reviewers may not understand
why some tests were modified. Especially if a pull request is big. They will most
probably blindly trust you and merge the pull request.</p>

<p>That’s why separating tests from code is a solution. First, the tests get modified
and the reviewers will pay attention only to the scope of tests. They will easily
catch you if the changes are too broad and are not related to the problem you
are solving. Then the code gets modified and reviewers don’t need to worry about
tests at all. They don’t pay attention to them, they only review the implementation.
They know that you can’t break the tests since the build pipeline
won’t allow you to do this.</p>

<p><a href="/2017/08/29/xcop.html">A few years ago</a>
I created <a href="https://github.com/yegor256/xcop">xcop</a>,
a simple command line tool that
can check the style of an XML file. It’s similar to
<a href="https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io">Checkstyle</a> (for Java) and
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pep8/">Pep8</a> (for Python),
but for XML. It’s pretty easy to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcop</code>: just run it with a few command
line arguments and it returns the list of errors found in your XML file, if there are any. However,
some of the arguments may be convenient to have as defaults and instead of
passing them through the command line on every execution, we could store them in some configuration file.
The question is: What is the best format for this file?
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOML">TOML</a>?
None of them! I suggest plain text.</p>

<figure class="jb_picture"><img itemprop="image" alt="The Trotsky (2009) by Jacob Tierney" src="/images/2022/07/the-trotsky.jpg" longdesc="#2a549763" /><figcaption id="2a549763">The Trotsky (2009) by Jacob Tierney</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s say, you want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcop</code> to check all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.xml</code> files in your repository,
but ignore XML files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.idea/</code> directory. You also want to make sure
all XML files have a license in their preamble. This is how you would
call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcop</code>:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ xcop --include '*.xml' --exclude '.idea/**' \
  --license LICENSE.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You have to use this set of arguments everywhere you call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcop</code>:
in the build script, in the CI/CD pipeline, and on your laptop when you check
that everything is correct. What some of us sometimes do is create a new
Bash file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">run_xcop.sh</code> with exactly this single command.</p>

<p>I suggest a better solution. You can create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcop</code>
plain text file in the root of the repository and put all
the required “default” command line options there, one per line:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>--include=*.xml
--exclude=.idea/**
--license=LICENSE.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, you can call the tool just like this:</p>

<div class="language-text highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ xcop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will find the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcop</code> file and will read all lines from it, treating
each of them as command line arguments. It will basically <em>concatenate</em>
what is provided in the command line with what is found in the file
with defaults.</p>

<p>I believe this approach is much better than YAML, JSON, XML, TOML, INI,
and other configuration formats simply because it doesn’t require us
users to learn two formats: one for command line options, another one
for the configuration file. We learn just one and use it interchangeably
either when we call the tool “manually” or when we configure its
behavior in the file with defaults.</p>

<p>By the way, it’s possible to configure the behavior of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xcop</code> globally
creating the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.xcop</code> (in the home directory of the user). The
defaults from this file will also be concatenated with the ones provided
in the command line and with the ones found in the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xcop</code> file.</p>

<p>I designed a few of my other command line tools using the same principle,
including

or just any tests that are being executed <em>automatically</em>. That’s the difference
between them and manual tests. What is the purpose of automated tests?
First and foremost, they reduce the amount of routine work: we don’t
need to remember how to test a module, the tests remember. We just click
a button and a suite of tests, which may consist of hundreds or thousands,
runs and reports errors, if any are found. Saving time is important,
but it’s not the only and, if you ask me, not the most important purpose
of automated tests. A more important one is their role as a safety net.</p>

<p>Do you know what a safety net is? Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_net">says</a> that
it is “a net to protect people from injury after falling from heights.”
You most probably have seen it on buildings which are being
constructed or reconstructed.
The red one in the picture is the safety net.</p>

<p>If construction workers accidentally fall down
or drop their tools, they won’t die and won’t kill anyone on the ground.
Does this knowledge help them work more effectively? I believe it does. I didn’t
find any research on this subject, comparing the productivity
of workers who know that there is a safety net beneath them with the productivity
of workers who know that a mistake would most probably cost them their lives or
the life of child playing on the ground. The results of such research are obvious though,
I believe.</p>

        <div>M199: Unit tests are the Safety Net that you can&#39;t afford to not use;
        24 June 2022.</div></aside>

<p>The same is true for us programmers. Modifying the source code and knowing that
there are no automated tests in place is similar to working at height
without a safety net: one mistake could cost you server downtime, a frustrated
customer, lost money, and maybe a lost job. How high would the productivity
of a programmer be while working like this? Do we need to do research to find out?
Or is the answer as obvious as for construction workers?</p>

<p>In order to give you enough confidence, automated tests must not only be
written and committed to a repository, but they must be automatically executed
before every change you try to make to the trunk. You must be able
to run them after every change you make locally, while incrementally developing the code.
Then, you must know that even if you accidentally forget to run them locally
and send your branch to the trunk for merging, the automated merge pipeline
will catch you.</p>

<p>The more time and effort you invest into making your safety net strong,
that is, the better your tests cover your code, then the more <em>productive</em> your
work will be, the safer you will feel in introducing new features or fixing bugs.
Simply put, you will code <em>faster</em> and <em>better</em>. Just because you know that
you can’t break what you did yesterday.</p>

<p>The first thing you do when you start a new software project is
implement a safety net: you automate the build pipeline and you create
a few simple automated tests. You make sure they protect you. Only then do you
start writing code. Ask construction workers: are they allowed to start a workday
without a safety net? Obviously not. I’m sure it’s even illegal. The same
must be true for us programmers: coding without the safety net of automated tests
must be illegal.</p>

<p>When a bug is reported to you by your customers, this should mean
that the safety net has a <em>hole</em>. It is not tight enough, that’s why the bug
fell down on the head of your customer. What do you do before you fix the bug?
You fix the safety net. You add more automated tests, which will catch this
bug in the future. Only then do you fix the bug.</p>

<p>I believe that the safety net of a software project is its most valuable asset.</p>]]></content><author><name>Yegor Bugayenko</name><email>yegor256@gmail.com</email></author><category term="testing" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modifying the source code and knowing that there are no automated tests in place is similar to working at height and knowing that a single mistake could cost you your life.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2022/06/safety-net.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.yegor256.com/images/2022/06/safety-net.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
