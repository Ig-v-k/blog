      <h1>ORM Is an Offensive Anti-Pattern</h1>
      <p>TL;DR ORM is a terrible <a href="/2016/02/03/design-patterns-and-anti-patterns.html">anti-pattern</a>
that violates all principles of
object-oriented programming, tearing
<a href="/2016/07/14/who-is-object.html">objects</a>
apart and turning them into dumb and passive
data bags. There is no excuse for ORM existence in any application, be it
a small web app or an enterprise-size system with thousands of tables and CRUD
manipulations on them. What is the alternative? <strong>SQL-speaking objects</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="how-orm-works">How ORM Works</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">Object-relational mapping</a>
(ORM) is a technique (a.k.a. design pattern) of
accessing a relational database from an object-oriented language
(Java, for example). There are multiple implementations of ORM
in almost every language; for example:
<a href="http://hibernate.org/orm/">Hibernate</a> for Java,
<a href="/2016/07/26/active-record.html">ActiveRecord</a> for Ruby on Rails,
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/">Doctrine</a> for PHP, and
<a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> for Python.
In Java, the ORM design is even standardized as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API">JPA</a>.</p>

<p>First, let’s see how ORM works, by example. Let’s use Java, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate.
Let’s say we have a single table in the database, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code>:</p>

<pre>+-----+------------+--------------------------+
| id  | date       | title                    |
+-----+------------+--------------------------+
|   9 | 10/24/2014 | How to cook a sandwich   |
|  13 | 11/03/2014 | My favorite movies       |
|  27 | 11/17/2014 | How much I love my job   |
+-----+------------+--------------------------+</pre>



<p>Now we want to CRUD-manipulate this table from our Java app (CRUD
stands for create, read, update, and delete). First, we should create
a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> class (I’m sorry it’s so long, but that’s the best I can do):</p>

<pre>@Entity
@Table(name = "post")
public class Post {
  private int id;
  private Date date;
  private String title;
  @Id
  @GeneratedValue
  public int getId() {
    return this.id;
  }
  @Temporal(TemporalType.TIMESTAMP)
  public Date getDate() {
    return this.date;
  }
  public Title getTitle() {
    return this.title;
  }
  public void setDate(Date when) {
    this.date = when;
  }
  public void setTitle(String txt) {
    this.title = txt;
  }
}</pre>

<p>Before any operation with Hibernate, we have to create a session factory:</p>

<pre>SessionFactory factory = new AnnotationConfiguration()
  .configure()
  .addAnnotatedClass(Post.class)
  .buildSessionFactory();</pre>

<p>This factory will give us “sessions” every time we want to manipulate
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> objects. Every manipulation with the session should be wrapped
in this code block:</p>

<pre>Session session = factory.openSession();
try {
  Transaction txn = session.beginTransaction();
  // your manipulations with the ORM, see below
  txn.commit();
} catch (HibernateException ex) {
  txn.rollback();
} finally {
  session.close();
}</pre>

<p>When the session is ready, here is how we get a list of all posts
from that database table:</p>

<pre>List posts = session.createQuery("FROM Post").list();
for (Post post : (List&lt;Post&gt;) posts){
  System.out.println("Title: " + post.getTitle());
}</pre>

<p>I think it’s clear what’s going on here. Hibernate is a big, powerful
engine that makes a connection to the database, executes necessary SQL
<code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> requests, and retrieves the data. Then it makes instances
of class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> and stuffs them with the data.
When the object comes to us, it is filled with data, and we should
use getters to take them out, like we’re using <code class="highlighter-rouge">getTitle()</code> above.</p>



<p>When we want to do a reverse operation and send an object to the
database, we do all of the same but in reverse order. We make an instance
of class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>, stuff it with the data, and ask Hibernate to save it:</p>

<pre>Post post = new Post();
post.setDate(new Date());
post.setTitle("How to cook an omelette");
session.save(post);</pre>

<p>This is how almost every ORM works. The basic principle is always the same—ORM objects are
<a href="/2016/07/06/data-transfer-object.html">anemic envelopes</a>
with data. We are talking with the ORM
framework, and the framework is talking to the database. Objects only help
us send our requests to the ORM framework and understand its response.
Besides <a href="/2016/07/18/law-of-demeter.html">getters and setters</a>,
objects have no other methods. They don’t even know
which database they came from.</p>

<p>This is how object-relational mapping works.</p>

<p>What’s wrong with it, you may ask? Everything!</p>

<h2 id="whats-wrong-with-orm">What’s Wrong With ORM?</h2>

<p>Seriously, what is wrong? Hibernate has been one of the most popular Java libraries
for more than 10 years already. Almost every SQL-intensive application in the world
is using it. Each Java tutorial would mention Hibernate (or maybe
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software">some other ORM</a>
like TopLink or OpenJPA) for a database-connected application. It’s a standard
<em>de-facto</em> and still I’m saying that it’s wrong? Yes.</p>

<p>I’m claiming that the entire idea behind ORM is wrong. Its invention
was maybe the second big mistake in
<a href="/2016/08/15/what-is-wrong-object-oriented-programming.html">OOP</a> after
<a href="/2014/05/13/why-null-is-bad.html">NULL reference</a>.</p>



<p>Actually, I’m not the only one saying something like this, and
definitely not the first. A lot about
this subject has already been published by very respected authors, including
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html">OrmHate</a> by Martin Fowler (not against ORM, but worth mentioning anyway),
<a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/object-relational-mapping-is-the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">Object-Relational Mapping Is the Vietnam of Computer Science</a> by Jeff Atwood,
<a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/post/the-vietnam-of-computer-science/">The Vietnam of Computer Science</a> by Ted Neward,
<a href="http://seldo.com/weblog/2011/08/11/orm_is_an_antipattern">ORM Is an Anti-Pattern</a> by Laurie Voss,
and many others.</p>

<p>However, my argument is different than what they’re saying. Even though their reasons are
practical and valid, like “ORM is slow” or “database upgrades are hard,”
they miss the main point. You can see a very good, practical answer
to these practical arguments given by Bozhidar Bozhanov
in his <a href="http://techblog.bozho.net/orm-haters-dont-get-it/">ORM Haters Don’t Get It</a> blog post.</p>



<p>The main point is that ORM, instead of encapsulating database interaction
inside an object, extracts it away, literally tearing a solid and cohesive
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">living organism</a> apart.
One part of the object keeps the data while another one, implemented inside
the ORM engine (session factory), knows how to deal with this data and transfers it to the
relational database. Look at this picture; it illustrates what ORM is doing.</p>

<p>I, being a reader of posts, have to deal with two components: 1) the ORM
and 2) the “ob-truncated” object returned to me. The behavior I’m interacting
with is supposed to be provided through a single entry point, which is an object
in OOP. In the case of ORM, I’m getting this behavior via <strong>two</strong> entry points—the ORM
engine and the “thing,” which we can’t even call an object.</p>

<p>Because of this terrible and offensive violation of the object-oriented
paradigm, we have a lot of practical issues already mentioned in
respected publications. I can only add a few more.</p>



<p><strong>SQL Is Not Hidden</strong>.
Users of ORM have to speak SQL
(or its dialect, like <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html">HQL</a>).
See the example above; we’re calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">session.createQuery("FROM Post")</code> in order
to get all posts. Even though it’s not SQL, it is very similar to it. Thus,
the relational model is not encapsulated inside objects. Instead, it is exposed
to the entire application. Everybody, with each object, inevitably has to
deal with a relational model in order to get or save something. Thus,
ORM doesn’t hide and wrap the SQL but pollutes the entire application with it.</p>

<p><strong>Difficult to Test</strong>.
When some object is working with a list of posts, it needs to deal with an
instance of <code class="highlighter-rouge">SessionFactory</code>. How can we
<a href="/2014/09/23/built-in-fake-objects.html">mock</a> this dependency? We have to
create a mock of it? How complex is this task? Look at the code above, and you
will realize how verbose and cumbersome that unit test will be. Instead,
we can write integration tests and connect the entire application to a test
version of PostgreSQL. In that case, there is no need to mock <code class="highlighter-rouge">SessionFactory</code>,
but such tests will be rather slow, and even more important, our
having-nothing-to-do-with-the-database objects will be tested against
the database instance. A terrible design.</p>

<p>Again, let me reiterate. Practical problems of ORM are just consequences. The
fundamental drawback is that ORM tears objects apart, terribly and offensively
violating the very idea of <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">what an object is</a>.</p>

<h2 id="sql-speaking-objects">SQL-Speaking Objects</h2>



<p>What is the alternative? Let me show it to you by example. Let’s try to design that
class, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>, my way. We’ll have to break it down into two classes: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code>, singular and plural. I already mentioned in one of my previous
<a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">articles</a> that
a good object is always an abstraction of a real-life entity. Here is how
this principle works in practice. We have two entities: database table
and table row. That’s why we’ll make two classes; <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code> will represent the
table, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> will represent the row.</p>

<p>As I also mentioned in that <a href="/2014/11/20/seven-virtues-of-good-object.html">article</a>,
every object should work by contract
and implement an interface. Let’s start our design with two
<a href="/2016/04/26/why-inputstream-design-is-wrong.html">interfaces</a>.
Of course, our objects will be
<a href="/2014/12/22/immutable-objects-not-dumb.html">immutable</a>.
Here is how <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code> would look:</p>

<pre>interface Posts {
  Iterable&lt;Post&gt; iterate();
  Post add(Date date, String title);
}</pre>

<p>This is how a single <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> would look:</p>

<pre>interface Post {
  int id();
  Date date();
  String title();
}</pre>

<p>Here is how we will list all posts in the database table:</p>

<pre>Posts posts = // we'll discuss this right now
for (Post post : posts.iterate()){
  System.out.println("Title: " + post.title());
}</pre>

<p>Here is how we will create a new post:</p>

<pre>Posts posts = // we'll discuss this right now
posts.add(new Date(), "How to cook an omelette");</pre>

<p>As you see, we have true objects now. They are in charge of all operations,
and they perfectly hide their implementation details. There are no transactions,
sessions, or factories. We don’t even know whether these objects are actually
talking to the PostgreSQL or if they keep all the data in text files. All
we need from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code> is an ability to list all posts for us and to create
a new one. Implementation details are perfectly hidden inside. Now let’s
see how we can implement these two classes.</p>



<p>I’m going to use <a href="http://jdbc.jcabi.com">jcabi-jdbc</a> as a JDBC wrapper,
but you can use something else like <a href="http://www.jooq.org">jOOQ</a>,
or just plain JDBC if you like. It doesn’t
really matter. What matters is that your database interactions are hidden
inside objects. Let’s start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code> and implement it in class
<code class="highlighter-rouge">PgPosts</code> (“pg” stands for PostgreSQL):</p>

<pre>final class PgPosts implements Posts {
  private final Source dbase;
  public PgPosts(DataSource data) {
    this.dbase = data;
  }
  public Iterable&lt;Post&gt; iterate() {
    return new JdbcSession(this.dbase)
      .sql("SELECT id FROM post")
      .select(
        new ListOutcome&lt;Post&gt;(
          new ListOutcome.Mapping&lt;Post&gt;() {
            @Override
            public Post map(final ResultSet rset) {
              return new PgPost(
                this.dbase,
                rset.getInt(1)
              );
            }
          }
        )
      );
  }
  public Post add(Date date, String title) {
    return new PgPost(
      this.dbase,
      new JdbcSession(this.dbase)
        .sql("INSERT INTO post (date, title) VALUES (?, ?)")
        .set(new Utc(date))
        .set(title)
        .insert(new SingleOutcome&lt;Integer&gt;(Integer.class))
    );
  }
}</pre>

<p>Next, let’s implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> interface in class <code class="highlighter-rouge">PgPost</code>:</p>

<pre>final class PgPost implements Post {
  private final Source dbase;
  private final int number;
  public PgPost(DataSource data, int id) {
    this.dbase = data;
    this.number = id;
  }
  public int id() {
    return this.number;
  }
  public Date date() {
    return new JdbcSession(this.dbase)
      .sql("SELECT date FROM post WHERE id = ?")
      .set(this.number)
      .select(new SingleOutcome&lt;Utc&gt;(Utc.class));
  }
  public String title() {
    return new JdbcSession(this.dbase)
      .sql("SELECT title FROM post WHERE id = ?")
      .set(this.number)
      .select(new SingleOutcome&lt;String&gt;(String.class));
  }
}</pre>

<p>This is how a full database interaction scenario would look like
using the classes we just created:</p>

<pre>Posts posts = new PgPosts(dbase);
for (Post post : posts.iterate()){
  System.out.println("Title: " + post.title());
}
Post post = posts.add(
  new Date(), "How to cook an omelette"
);
System.out.println("Just added post #" + post.id());</pre>

<p>You can see a full practical example <a href="https://github.com/aintshy/hub/tree/0.7.2/src/main/java/com/aintshy/pgsql">here</a>.
It’s an open source
web app that works with PostgreSQL using the exact approach explained
above—SQL-speaking objects.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-performance">What About Performance?</h2>

<p>I can hear you screaming, “What about performance?” In that script
a few lines above, we’re making many redundant round trips to the database.
First, we retrieve post IDs with <code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT id</code> and then, in order to get their titles,
we make an extra <code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT title</code> call for each post. This is inefficient, or simply
put, too slow.</p>

<p>No worries; this is object-oriented programming, which means it is flexible! Let’s create
a decorator of <code class="highlighter-rouge">PgPost</code> that will accept all data in its constructor
and cache it internally, forever:</p>

<pre>final class ConstPost implements Post {
  private final Post origin;
  private final Date dte;
  private final String ttl;
  public ConstPost(Post post, Date date, String title) {
    this.origin = post;
    this.dte = date;
    this.ttl = title;
  }
  public int id() {
    return this.origin.id();
  }
  public Date date() {
    return this.dte;
  }
  public String title() {
    return this.ttl;
  }
}</pre>

<p>Pay attention: This decorator doesn’t know anything about PostgreSQL or
JDBC. It just decorates an object of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Post</code> and pre-caches the date
and title. As usual, this decorator is also immutable.</p>

<p>Now let’s create another implementation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Posts</code> that will return
the “constant” objects:</p>

<pre>final class ConstPgPosts implements Posts {
  // ...
  public Iterable&lt;Post&gt; iterate() {
    return new JdbcSession(this.dbase)
      .sql("SELECT * FROM post")
      .select(
        new ListOutcome&lt;Post&gt;(
          new ListOutcome.Mapping&lt;Post&gt;() {
            @Override
            public Post map(final ResultSet rset) {
              return new ConstPost(
                new PgPost(
                  ConstPgPosts.this.dbase,
                  rset.getInt(1)
                ),
                Utc.getTimestamp(rset, 2),
                rset.getString(3)
              );
            }
          }
        )
      );
  }
}</pre>

<p>Now all posts returned by <code class="highlighter-rouge">iterate()</code> of this new class are pre-equipped with dates and titles
fetched in one round trip to the database.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/2015/02/26/composable-decorators.html">decorators</a>
and multiple implementations of the same interface, you
can compose any functionality you wish. What is the most important is that
while functionality is being extended, the complexity of the design is
not escalating, because classes don’t grow in size. Instead, we’re introducing
new classes that stay cohesive and solid, because they are small.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-transactions">What About Transactions?</h2>

<p>Every object should deal with its own transactions and encapsulate
them the same way as <code class="highlighter-rouge">SELECT</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">INSERT</code> queries. This will lead to
nested transactions, which is perfectly fine provided the database
server supports them. If there is no such support, create a session-wide
transaction object that will accept a “callable” class. For example:</p>

<pre>final class Txn {
  private final DataSource dbase;
  public &lt;T&gt; T call(Callable&lt;T&gt; callable) {
    JdbcSession session = new JdbcSession(this.dbase);
    try {
      session.sql("START TRANSACTION").exec();
      T result = callable.call();
      session.sql("COMMIT").exec();
      return result;
    } catch (Exception ex) {
      session.sql("ROLLBACK").exec();
      throw ex;
    }
  }
}</pre>

<p>Then, when you want to wrap a few object manipulations in one
transaction, do it like this:</p>

<pre>new Txn(dbase).call(
  new Callable&lt;Integer&gt;() {
    @Override
    public Integer call() {
      Posts posts = new PgPosts(dbase);
      Post post = posts.add(
        new Date(), "How to cook an omelette"
      );
      post.comments().post("This is my first comment!");
      return post.id();
    }
  }
);</pre>

<p>This code will create a new post and post a comment to it. If one
of the calls fail, the entire transaction will be rolled back.</p>

<p>This approach looks object-oriented to me. I’m calling it “SQL-speaking objects,”
because they know how to speak SQL with the database server. It’s their
