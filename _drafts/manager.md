  you are a bad employee; instead, you should bring your
  own plans and defend them.

There are good and bad soldiers in any team. The job of a manager is to
understand who is who. Then, promote the good ones and discharge the bad ones.
There is one simple indicator I use to make this segregation. It's a simple
question I either hear from my people or don't. Those who ask it
are the bad soldiers. Their attitude and their behavior require immediate
corrective actions. Some of them are curable, while other are not. This
question tells me everything, if it's being asked. I immediately understand
that I deal with a loser, if I hear it.

The question is: "What should I do next?"

What's wrong with it, you may wonder? Let me explain by a counter example.
A good soldier behaves differently. A good one wants to do interesting things,
wants to work with the most challenging problems, wants to resolve complex
issues, and wants to do what he/she wants to do!
A good one cares and doesn't want to do what's not important or not interesting.
A good one asks "What is our ultimate goal?" and then, after getting my answer and thinking
for a while, comes back to me with a plan of achiving this goal. A good one
_tells_ me what is next, instead of asking. All I need to do is to approve
or reject the plan proposed.

Good ones don't sit and wait until I come to them and say what exactly
needs to be done. Good solders build their own plans by themselves and
do everything to convince me that they make sense.

Bad ones, instead, ask me "What's next?" and it sounds very annoying.
It's absolutely no fun to work with these people and I either try to explain them
why such a question is a terrible mistake, or simply get rid of them.

By the way, I [googled](https://www.google.com/search?q=questions+you+never+ask+your+boss)
"questions you never ask your boss" and found
a lot of articles, which suggest to prohibit many different questions. I'm not
surprised, but none of them mention the question I'm talking about.
