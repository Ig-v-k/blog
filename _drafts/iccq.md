  experience, which may help you do the same.

First, let me clarify what kind of conference we are talking about. 
There are two types of them:
[professional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_conference)
and
[academic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_conference).
The difference is [huge](https://redmonk.com/kfitzpatrick/2019/01/29/tech-industry-events-vs-academic-conferences/).
My understanding is that professional conferences are for _practitioners_, 
while academic ones are for _researchers_.
ICCQ, which we organized this year, is an academic one.
I haven't had any expertise in organizing such things, and had to go through it all for the first time.
Here is a more or less detailed description of the journey.
Feel free to repeat it for yourself and make a similar conference.

Here I assume that you are an organizer of the event. 

**Make a Name**.
There are many options to chose from, but it seems to me
that the de-facto standard is a few letters, all-caps, like
[SPLASH](https://conf.researchr.org/series/splash), 
[ICSE](http://www.icse-conferences.org/), 
[PLDI](https://pldi21.sigplan.org/), 
[PLOP](https://www.hillside.net/plop/2020/), 
[etc.](https://www.guide2research.com/topconf/) 
There are expections like [EuroSys](https://2021.eurosys.org/)
or [EuroS&P](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/EuroSP2021/) but
this naming is much less popular.
Make sure you have a good domain name for your conference name
preferrably with a `.org` extension.

**Pick a Subject**.
Many <del>bad</del> conferences aim at many topics in order to 
attract more papers. I suggest to behave completely differently: 
pick a single topic and focus on it. We picked
_code quality_ and rejected all papers, which were not relevant.
We didn't even publish the list of topics, like many other
events do. We just said that we are about code quality and 
how to make it better. That's all.

**Dates**.
The date of the conference should be _at least_ one year ahead of you.
We scheduled it closer and had to reschedule, when we realized that
we can't manage in just eight months. You will need three important dates
on top of the date of the event: 
1) submission deadline, four months before the event, 
2) author notification, two months after the submission,
3) camera-ready copies,
