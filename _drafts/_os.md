Some companies massively invest in open source software projects,
while others still remain skeptical and stay away from this trend.
What's in it for those philantropists, like Google, IBM or Microsoft?
Why spending money on something that doesn't belong to them and
is shared among all of us developers? Don't they understand that
the code they sponsor may be used by their competitors? It seems they
do understand, but can't do anything about it.

As David Mytton
[noted](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3028600/whats-the-real-reason-microsoft-and-google-are-releasing-open-source.html),
individuals release open source projects for the altruism,
while companies have real, strategic reasons hidden behind
the warm and fuzzy glow of open source. We don't mean using
open source products, which is what every business does nowadays,
but building them

This is exactly how companies invest in open source
(among [other methods](https://opensource.com/article/19/4/ways-support-sustain-open-source)):

  * **Committers**.
    Google, for example, encourages its employees to
    open their code, and even has an
    [approval procedure](https://opensource.google/docs/releasing/approval/) for it.
    It seems that others do something similar.
    A recently published [research](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3253948/who-really-contributes-to-open-source.html)
    demonstrated that thousands (!) of employees from
    [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) (4.3k visible GitHub contributors),
    [Google](https://github.com/google) (1.2k),
    [RedHat](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial) (5),
    [IBM](https://github.com/IBM) (2.3k),
    [Intel](https://github.com/intel) (39), and
    [others](https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-an-open-source-world-78-percent-of-companies-run-open-source-software/)
    actively contribute to their GitHub-hosted repositories.
    In other words, getting paid by Google these people write
    code that doesn't belong to Google.

  * **Events**.
    Aside from
    [Google Cloud Next](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/),
    [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/), and
    [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite),
    which are pure promotional events, tech giants sponsor
    community-driven conferences, like
    [DockerCon](https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/),
    [KubeCon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe/),
    [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/),
    and so on.

  * **Foundations**
    [Apache](http://www.apache.org/foundation/thanks),
    [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/members/),
    [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php#allmembers),
    [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/foundation/),
    [OSI](https://opensource.org/sponsors)
    and [other foundations](https://opensource.com/resources/organizations)
    are sponsored by Google, IBM, Huawei, Microsof, Oracle, and others.

  * **Acquisitions**.
    They [acquire](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/12/how-open-source-software-took-over-the-world/)
    startups that make open source products,
    e.g.
    [RedHat](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial)
      (acquired by IBM for [$32b](https://www.technologyreview.com/the-download/612353/ibms-34-billion-purchase-of-red-hat-is-a-mega-bet-on-a-coding-revolution/?via=indexdotco)),
    [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
      ([$4b](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/mongodb-shares-rally-above-already-elevated-ipo-price-2017-10-19)),
    [Docker](https://github.com/docker)
      ([$1b](https://venturebeat.com/2015/06/13/docker-now-valued-at-1b-paid-someone-799-for-its-logo-on-99designs/)),
    [Elastic](https://github.com/elastic)
      ([$6b](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/05/search-company-elastic-pops-90-on-nyse-after-raising-252m-at-a-2-5b-market-cap-in-its-ipo/)),
    [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible)
      ([$100m](http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/15/source-red-hat-is-buying-ansible-for-more-than-100m/)),
    [MySQL](https://github.com/mysql)
      ([$1b](https://techcrunch.com/2008/01/16/sun-picks-up-mysql-for-1-billion-open-source-is-a-legitimate-business-model/)),
    [Nginx](https://github.com/nginx/nginx)
      ([$670m](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/f5-acquires-nginx-for-670m-to-move-into-open-source-multi-cloud-services/)),
    and [so on](https://index.co/market/open-source/acquisitions).
    The market is [booming](https://a16z.com/2019/10/04/commercializing-open-source/), by the way.

  * **Donations**.
    Google, for example, [donates](https://opensource.google/docs/growing/funding/) to
      [Fastlane](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane)
      and
      [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes);
    IBM [donates](https://www.ibm.com/opensource/) to
      [Nodejs](https://xomino.com/2015/06/18/ibm-is-a-platinum-sponsor-of-the-new-node-js-foundation/)
      and
      [TensorFlow](https://conferences.oreilly.com/tensorflow/tf-ca-2019/public/schedule/detail/81284);
    Amazon sponsors
      [Rust](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/aws-sponsorship-of-the-rust-project/);
    and [so on](https://github.com/ossfriendly/open-source-supporters).

Now, the question is how this helps Google and others to make their
business more profitable? For example, how Google Cloud Platform is planning
to beat Amazon AWS, using open source as a weapon? Here is how,
among [other reasons](https://simplabs.com/blog/2019/11/11/why-companies-invest-in-oss/):

  * **Selling**.
    The products they sponsor gather large communities of users,
    who know how to work with them. Some of the those users are decision-making
    people. For example, [Google's Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
    is a hosted version of
    [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), an open source product.
    Kubernetes users, when they need
    a hosted version of it, will most likely become Google customers.
    [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow),
    yet another example, also runs on [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/tensorflow-enterprise).

  * **Retaining**.
    Being an active participant of a visible open source software product
    is a great intrinsic motivator for the best software engineers.
    When a company is involved in open source business, its developers
    are much more loyal and interested in staying longer with the company.
    I can't prove this statement, it's just my personal observation.

  * **Influencing**.
    In modern software development world open source is key media, where
    programmers learn new ideas, design principles, and architectural solutions.
    They listen to open source projects, because they trust them much more
    than they trust Google, IBM or Microsoft. Tech companies are smart, but their
    decisions are based on monetary reasons, while open source projects
    are much more free to do what is right, instead of what is profitable.
    And programmers usually get very skeptical when open projects are acquired
    by large enterprises, like
    [Java by Oracle](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/2e2c1o/what_do_we_hate_oracle_for/)
    or [GitHub by Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17474284/microsoft-github-acquisition-developer-reaction)
    (not really an open source story, but very close).
    It's much wiser to sponsor open source and stay behind the curtain
    than directly talking to developers through corporate media
    like [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) or [OPN](https://developer.oracle.com/).

  * **Branding**.
    Being part of open source is a direct contribution to the public
    image of a company. Google is not anymore an
    [Ad-selling monopoly](https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857440/google-antitrust-investigation-attorneys-general-advertising-search),
    with [questionable reputation](https://www.androidauthority.com/googles-reputation-is-becoming-its-biggest-problem-1055381/),
    but one of the largest software [philantropists](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/open_source_software_is_philanthropy).
    Microsoft is [catching up](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/microsoft-reputation-institute-soaring-research-2019-11/?r=US&IR=T)
    with its massive [code opening](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/whats-really-behind-microsofts-love-of-open-source/)
    and the [purchase](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2018/10/26/microsoft-completes-github-acquisition/) of GitHub.

  * **Training**.
    It's [no secret](https://www.wired.com/insights/2013/11/open-source-a-platform-for-innovation/)
    that the [best technologies](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-best-open-source-innovations-of-the-last-decade/)
    nowadays are being created
    in open source projects by people contributing for free
    (they get their salaries somewhere else). It's also a
    [well-known fact](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-become-the-best-programmer-in-the-world-ef9f584c81fa)
    that in order to be a better engineer one has to work with the best.
    Open source projects is [exactly](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/10-tips-for-becoming-a-better-programmer/)
    the best place where
    one meets more experienced and very often more talented programmers,
    and learn from them. Companies, sending people there, boost
    their skills without doing any internal training programs.

Thus, it seems that open source is a very powerful instrument
in the war for tech markets. Smart companies develop their open source
muscles, slowly earning reputation and acquiring our trust. I predict
this trend not only to continue but also to escalate. If you are a software,
make your own project now. Sooner or later Google will knock the door and offer
you a big check, just to do it earlier than Microsoft.
