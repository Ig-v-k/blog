It's a well-known problem nowadays: how can we measure the performance 
and productivity of individual contributors, which do non-routine 
creative work? The best examples are research and development (R&D) teams, which 
usually consist of software engineers, designers, 
scientific researchers, architects, quality experts, product managers, and so on. 
Such professionals deliver results that are hard to get down to simple numbers. 
Many authors argue that the very idea of measuring individual performance is toxic and may only 
lead to negative consequences. We tried to challenge this point of view 
and made an experiment in our team, which demonstrated that individual 
performance can indeed be measured, even if people's work involves creativity, 
and results are hard to predict. We designed a system of 
Calibrated Achievement Points (CAP), which are rewarded to those who deliver 
visible and tangible results of different kinds. The article explains how 
CAP work and summarizes the results of the experiment.

they say metrics are bad, quote them

it's true -> our reasons from our experience

however, lack of metrics is even worse -> subjectivity in management + quotes

    The ‘Free-Rider Effect’ happens once team members realise that other members of the group will pull their weight for them, and they can easily get away with it because individual performance isn't being closely monitored. For example, if you have a team working to deliver an annual conference, you could find that one team member misses project meetings, avoids set tasks or doesn't contribute to planning effectively.

    The Sucker Effect
    Free-riders don't go unnoticed. Once the hard-working members of the group realise not everyone is pulling their weight, the ‘Sucker Effect’ enters the equation. To avoid being a ‘sucker’, these typically high-performing employees hold back to bring equilibrium to the team.

thus, bad metrics hurt. what are the good metrics? are they possible? they do help:

    https://www.td.org/insights/why-do-performance-management-systems-fail
    Only 14 percent of organizations are happy with their performance management system.
    Despite the enormous amount of time and effort invested, only 23 percent of HR executives think that their performance management process accurately reflects employee contributions.

    https://www.samewave.com/posts/performance-management-systems-why-promise-based-management-works
    The social discipline behind promise-based management creates a heightened sense of awareness because an employee knows their goals are visible to their team members. That transparency makes it easier to gauge individual contributions and employee performance while creating the opportunity to weave a reward system into the public space with positive feedback.

    they must be continuous:

    Since 2015, this phi­los­o­phy of con­tin­u­ous per­for­mance man­age­ment has been adopt­ed by lead­ing organ­i­sa­tions such as Microsoft, Deloitte, Adobe and Gen­er­al Elec­tric. All these major names have aban­doned tra­di­tion­al once-a-year per­for­mance appraisals in favour of reg­u­lar​”check-ins” and fre­quent (or real-time) feedback. 

we made a system of CAPs, this is how it works

it is similar to what suggested by ...
