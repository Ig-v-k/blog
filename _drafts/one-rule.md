When I make a slidedeck for a new presentation, invent a new domain name, think about
a name for a new Java class, itemize bullet points in a academic paper, even
write an email---I try to follow a simple principle, which helps me make
my content more solid. Well, I believe it does. Maybe it will help you as well.
The principle is simple: at all cost, try to squeeze a content into
one word, one sentence, one paragraph, or one page.

A more formal definition of the principle would be this:
it's either one word/sentence/paragraph/page or way more than three.
Let's see an example. Say, I need to list my plans for tomorrow:

{% highlight java %}

{% endhighlight %}
