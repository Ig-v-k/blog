  The principle is simple: a piece of text must
  either consist of a single word or many more,
  but nothing in the middle.

When I make a slidedeck for a new presentation, invent a new domain name, think about
a name for a new Java class, itemize bullet points in a academic paper, even
write an email---I try to follow a simple principle, which helps me make
my content more solid. Well, at least I believe it does. Maybe it will help you as well.
The principle is simple: at all cost, try to squeeze the content into
_one_ word, _one_ sentence, _one_ paragraph, or _one_ page.

<!--more-->

{% jb_picture_body %}

A more formal definition of the principle would be this:
it's either one word/sentence/paragraph/page _or_ way more.
Let's see an example. Say, I need to list my plans for tomorrow:

{% highlight text %}
- write a new article
- send an email to my boss
- cook a dinner
- take a nap
{% endhighlight %}

Do all of them need to be longer than one word? Not really. The "take a nap"
is just three as well as "cook a dinner". Three may not be considered
as "way more" than one. Besides, they can be shortened without the
loss of their meaning. Thus, I have to decide whether to make them all _much_
longer than one word or shorten them all to a single one.
The second choice is always preferrable:

{% highlight text %}
- article
- email
- dinner
- nap
{% endhighlight %}

I wrote about [compound variable names]({% pst 2015/jan/2015-01-12-compound-name-is-code-smell %})
earlier: the same principle is applicable
to them. Variables must either be nouns without any other words around them,
or take many more words, which is an exceptional situation.

In my earlier [blog post about resumes]({% pst 2016/mar/2016-03-08-pimp-up-your-resume %})
I mentioned that a good CV must take exactly one page.
If it's more, it should be many more. But definitely not two
or three pages.

I suggest applying this principle to every piece of content
you write: try to squeeze it into _one_.
