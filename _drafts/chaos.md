Being yet another software developer in a large enterprise is a pain. You are surrounded
by legacy code, inconsistent architecture, low quality standards (if they ever exist),
lack of coding discipline, broken or dirty unit tests, and so on. On top of
that, the management is very chaotic: no strict plans, no task
management, no objective metrics, no quality control, and no light at the
end of the tunnel. You feel like a cog in the machine: arrive at nine,
leave at five, and be quiet. Paychecks will keep coming.

It is a pain indeed. If you are talented and ambitious, sooner or later, you will
start thinking about a <del>suicide</del> resignation.

But, hold on. Try to think differently!

Look at it from a different perspective. Imagine what would be if everything would
look totally different: the architecture is clean, the code is perfect,
the documentation is outstanding, the team is full of genius experts,
the management is transparent, the plans are up to date, all metrics are
defined and regularly collected, and the quality is under tight control.
This would be the end of the tunnel! There would be no room for improvement
anymore, since everything is perfect. How would you feel yourself?
It seems that exactly this scenario would give you the feeling of being
a cog in the well-oiled machine.

If you want to make a career and you have the energy for it,
the first scenario is a much better place: the system _needs_
improvements. Of course, the one who makes them,
gets the rewards: bonuses, promotion, raise, and so on.

If you see the issues around you, both technical and management, and you
know how to fix them---great! This means that you already are ahead
of many others, who decided to put up with the routine and just wait
for the next paycheck. Use this situation to contribute and succeed.

Thus, those who complain about the system are the ones who are looking
forward to being those cogs in the machine. They don't see themselves as
system changers. They expect to play by the rules and expect the system to take care of them.
Don't be like that. This is not how you build your career up. This is only
how you spend another few years with no fun.

Instead, embrace the chaos!

Be thankful for its existence---you can grow only because of it.
