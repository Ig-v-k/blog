  Object-oriented programming is not researched well,
  especially in the area of quality and elegance of code;
  these topics would be great to pay attention to.

Object-oriented programming is a very old discipline of computer
science. Probably, as old as [Simula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula)
language, where OOP started. There were tons of books and articles
written about it since then. However, a few years ago we made an attempt
to re-think some aspects of OOP and called it [Elegant Objects](https://www.elegantobject.org).
This re-thinking opened many interesting questions for us, which need
additional research. We claimed many things to be "wrong," without
any formal proof. In this blog post I decided to put together a few
hypothesises which need such a proof. If you are researcher, a PhD
candidate, a student, or just someone interested in computer science,
pick any of them and try to investigate and publish your results. Once published,
let me know, I will try to make your results as visible as possible.
