      <h1>Operator new() is Toxic</h1>
      <p>To instantiate objects, in most object-oriented languages,
including Java, Ruby, and C++, we use operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">new()</code>. Well, unless
we use static factory methods, which we don’t use because
<a href="/2017/11/14/static-factory-methods.html">they are evil</a>.
Even though it looks so easy to make a new object any time we need it,
I would recommend to be more careful with this rather toxic operator.</p>



<amp-img src="/images/2018/01/the-gift.jpg" alt="The Gift (2015) by Joel Edgerton" height="803" width="1280" layout="responsive"></amp-img>

<p>I’m sure you understand that the problem with this operator is that
it couples objects, making testing and reuse very difficult or even impossible.
Let’s say there is a story in a file that we need to read as a UTF-8 text
(I’m using
<a href="http://static.javadoc.io/org.cactoos/cactoos/0.25.6/org/cactoos/text/TextOf.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">TextOf</code></a>
from <a href="http://www.cactoos.org">Cactoos</a>):</p>

<pre>class Story {
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(
      new File("/tmp/story.txt")
    ).asString();
  }
}</pre>

<p>It seems super simple, but the problem is obvious: class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code> can’t
be reused. It can only read one particular file. Moreover, testing it
will be rather difficult, since it reads the content from exactly one place,
which can’t be changed at all. More formally this problem is known as an
<em>unbreakable dependency</em>—we can’t break the link between <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">/tmp/story.txt</code>—they are together forever.</p>

<p>To solve this we need to introduce a constructor and let <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code> accept
the location of the content as an argument:</p>

<pre>class Story {
  private final File file;
  Story(File f) {
    this.file = f;
  }
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(this.file).asString();
  }
}</pre>

<p>Now, each user of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code> has to know the name of the file:</p>

<pre>new Story(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));</pre>

<p>It’s not really
convenient, especially for those users who were using <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code> before, knowing
nothing about the file path. To help them we introduce
a <a href="/2015/05/28/one-primary-constructor.html">secondary constructor</a>:</p>

<pre>class Story {
  private final File file;
  Story() { // Here!
    this(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));
  }
  Story(File f) {
    this.file = f;
  }
  String text() {
    return new TextOf(this.file).asString();
  }
}</pre>

<p>Now we just make an instance through a no-arguments constructor, just like
we did before:</p>

<pre>new Story();</pre>

<p>I’m sure you’re well aware of this technique, which is also known
as <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html">dependency injection</a>.
I’m actually not saying anything new. What I want you to pay attention to here is
the location and the amount of <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> operators in all three code snippets.</p>

<p>In the first snippet both <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> operators are in the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">text()</code>.
In the second snippet we lost one of them. In the third snippet one operator
is in the method, while the second one moved up, to the constructor.</p>

<p>Remember this fact and let’s move on.</p>

<p>What if the file is not in UTF-8 encoding but in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOI8-R">KOI8-R</a>?
Class <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextOf</code> and then method <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story.text()</code> will throw an exception.
However, class <code class="highlighter-rouge">TextOf</code> is capable of reading in any encoding, it just
needs to have a secondary argument for its constructor:</p>

<pre>new TextOf(this.file, "KOI8_R").asString();</pre>

<p>In order to make <code class="highlighter-rouge">Story</code> capable of using different encodings, we need to
introduce a few additional secondary constructors and modify its primary
constructor:</p>

<pre>class Story {
  private final Text text;
  Story() {
    this(new File("/tmp/story.txt"));
  }
  Story(File f) {
    this(f, StandardEncodings.UTF_8);
  }
  Story(File f, Encoding e) {
    this(new TextOf(f, e));
  }
  Story(Text t) {
    this.text = t;
  }
  String text() {
    return this.text.asString();
  }
}</pre>

<p>It’s just dependency injection, but pay attention to the locations
of the operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code>. They are all in the
constructors now and none of them are left in the method <code class="highlighter-rouge">text()</code>.</p>

<p>The tendency here is obvious to me: the more the <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> operators stay in the
methods, the less reusable and testable is the class.</p>

<p>In other words, operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">new</code> is a rather toxic thing, so try to keep its
usage to a minimum in your methods. Make sure you instantiate everything
or almost everything in your secondary constructors.</p>
